1. Run the server (Server.java) locally
2. Run Client.java to join game! Make sure hostName in ClientScreen.java = "localhost"

## Play on multiple devices (on the same network):
1. Run the server (Server.java)
2. In ClientScreen.java, set hostName to your server's IP address
4. Now you can connect multiple players across devices on the same network, and play against each other!
